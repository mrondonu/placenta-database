R (4.1) scripts were used to create a count table from BAM files and the human transcriptome G (including coding and non-coding RNA species) using the featureCounts function of Rsubread (2.8.2). Differential expression was calculated using a pipeline of EdgeR (4.2.1), and Limma (3.60.3) packages. Gene set enrichment was calculated by the camera function in the limma package. Human gene ontology files were obtained from the enrichment map resource (download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets/). Human placental ontologies were from supplemental files from Naismith and Cox, 2021. Barcode graphs were generated using the barcode function in limma. Removal of dNK gene expression was accomplished using the granulator package in R applying the detanglr algorithm to estimate the transcriptional contribution of the NK cells to the co-cultured bulk mRNA signal. The dNK and organoid samples were used to estimate the pure signal. The estimated mean contribution was removed in limma as a fitted model.

The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer.

Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Read filtering, alignment, cell and peak calling, as well as cell-by-peak count matrix generation were performed using the “count” option (cellranger-atac count) with default parameters.
Downstream analysis was performed using Signac (Stuart et al. 2021). The count matrix was filtered for cells where at least 15% of all fragments fell within peaks, cells with less than 5% of fragments falling within blacklist regions, cells with less than 4% nucleosome signal, cells with greater than 2% enrichment for transcription start sites, and peaks with a minimum of 2500 fragments and a maximum of 20000 fragments.
Cell clusters were identified using the FindNeighbors function with parameters “reduction = ‘lsi’, dims = 2:30’ and FindClusters function with parameters “algorithm = 3, resolution = 0.5”. Upon initial clustering, cluster-specific peaks were called with MACS2 using the function CallPeaks with parameters “group.by = ‘idents’”. These peaks were used to generate a final SIGNAC object which was used for all downstream analyses.
Fragment counts were mapped to peaks using FeatureMatrix with parameters “process_n = 2000”.
Filtering and clustering were performed on the new object as described above. Peaks were then filtered for mean accessibility, keeping all peaks with greater than 0.1 mean accessibility across cells.

A pseudo-hybrid (Mus domesticus X Mus spretus) genome using was generated based on the mouse genome (GRCm38.89) using the genome preparation tool of the program SNPsplit (Brabraham Bioinformatics). All placenta samples were mapped to the pseudo-hybrid genome.
The RRBS reads were mapped to the converted pseudo-hybrid genome using the Bismark Bisulfite Aligner (Babraham Bioinformatics, http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/).
We filtered the resulting alignment files using SAMtools 0.1.19 (Li et al. 2009), retaining only high quality (MAPQ score 40), uniquely mapped, paired reads for analysis.
We randomly downsampled all alignment files to the same number of reads (~10 million reads) using SAMtools 0.1.19 (Li et al. 2009).
To analyze allele specific methylation (ASM) in hybrids we split the hybrid alignment files with SNPsplit as described above for RNAseq alignments, but using the bisulfite option of the program.
CpG methylation information was extracted from the alignment files using the Bismark-methylation-extractor tool (Babraham Bioinformatics).
Differential methylation (DM) and ASM were analyzed in SeqMonk (Babraham Bioinformatics, http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/).

DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov) and IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) were used to reveal the Gene Ontology (GO) and pathways, respectively. Cells with more than 8,000 detected genes and for which genes with FPKM > 0.3 were kept in downstream analysis for lineage specification. Lineage specification was performed by Spearman correlation. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were performed using R

Chromatin was sonicated to 100-500 bp for the subsequent experiments. ATAC-seq: ATAC-seq was performed as previously report[50]. In brief, a total of 50,000 cells were washed once with 50 µl of cold PBS and resuspended in 50 µl lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630). After centrifugation at 4℃, suspension of nuclei diluted to 5 ng/µl in the elution buffer (10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8) and followed by the addition of 50 µl transposition reaction mix of DNA Library Prep Kit V2 for Illumina (Vazyme, TD501).
RNA-seq: Total RNA was extracted from TSCs by Trizol and RNA-Seq library were generated using RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, E7530L) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. ChIP-seq: The samples were pre-incubated with protein A/G Dynabeads (Life Technologies, 10015D) and the beads were then removed. Subsequently, the sample was added with 8 mg of Klf5(Sigma, 09-822) or H3K27ac antibody and rotated overnight at 4℃. Beads were washed four times with a Wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS), eluted and reverse crosslinked. Paired-end 125 bp sequencing was performed on Illumina Hiseq X-Ten. ATAC-seq: The reaction mix was gently mixed and incubated at 55℃ for 10 min. ATAC-seq library was amplified in 9 cycles. Libraries were purified using Qiagen PCR Cleanup Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Library concentrations were measured by KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems, KK4824) according to the manufacturer's instructions and checked by gel electrophoresis. Lastly, ATAC libraries were sequenced on Illumina Hiseq X-Ten.","ATAC-seq; ChIP-Seq; 	RNA-Seq",transcriptomic; genomic,cDNA; ChIP; other,HiSeq X Ten,,"	RNA-seq: Reads of RNA-seq were mapped to the mm10 genome with STAR[51] using the ENCODE standard options. Gene expression levels were quantified by Stringtie using the refFlat database[52] from the UCSC genome browser. Differentially expressed genes follow this criteria: fold change > 2, FDR < 0.05 in knockdown sample for upregulated genes, fold change < 0.5, FDR < 0.05 and in control sample for downregulated genes.GO enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes was used in DAVID. ChIP-seq: Reads were trimmed using TrimGlare and then mapped to the mm10 genome using Bowtie2 (v4.4.7) with parameters '-X 2000'. Multi-mapped and unmapped and low-quality reads were removed using samtools (v1.11) (10.1093/bioinformatics/btp352) and PCR duplicates were removed using the MarkDuplicates command from Picard tools (v2.6.0). ChIP-Seq peaks were called using MACS2 (v2.2.6) (10.1186/gb-2008-9-9-r137) with '-q 0.01' parameters. Annotation was performed using ChIPseeker version 1.22.1 (10.1093/bioinformatics/btv145). ATAC-seq: Raw files (fastq format) processed through the ATAC-seq pipeline published by ENCODE. Briefly, reads were trimmed, filtered, and aligned to mm10. All unmapped reads, reads with low mapping quality (MAPQ < 30) and PCR duplicates were removed. MACS2 was used to call peaks for each individual sample with the ""-nomodel"" and ""--shift -100 --extsize 200"" parameters. The bam files of the replicates were then merged together using Samtools. Peak files were merged using Bedops (v2.4.38) (10.1093/bioinformatics/bts277) merge to obtain a consensus set of peaks across samples. The number of reads that fell into the peaks was obtained using bedtools multicov (v2.27.0) (10.1093/bioinformatics/btq033). Then we normalized the read counts by computing the numbers of reads per kilobase of bin per million of reads sequenced (RPKM) by custom scripts. Limma was used for determining hyper and hypo-accessible peaks across different samples using default parameters. Peaks were called as hyper or hypo-accessible using abs( log2 fold change ) > 0.5 and adjusted P < 0.05. For each sample, the Pearson correlation between replicates was calculated using the peaks that had an RPKM > 5 in at least one of the replicates.

Forkhead box a2 (FOXA2) is expressed specifically in the glands of the uterus and a critical regulator of glandular epithelium (GE) differentiation, development and function. Mice with a conditional deletion of FOXA2 in the adult uterus, created using the lactotransferrin iCre (Ltf-iCre) model, have a morphologically normal uterus with glands, but lack a considerable number of FOXA2-dependent GE-expressed genes. Adult FOXA2 conditional knockout (cKO; Ltf-iCre:Foxa2 flox) mice are infertile due to defective embryo implantation arising from a lack of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a critical implantation factor of uterine gland origin. Intraperitoneal injections of LIF can initiate embryo implantation in the uterus of adult FOXA2 cKO mice with pregnancies maintained to term. Here, we tested the hypothesis that FOXA2-regulated genes in the uterine glands impact development of the decidua, placenta and fetus. On gestational day (GD) 8.5, the anti-mesometrial and mesometrial decidua transcriptome was noticeably altered in FOXA2 cKO mice. Viable fetuses were reduced in FOXA2 cKO mice on GDs 12.5 and 17.5. Sex-dependent differences in fetal weight, placenta histoarchitecture, and the placenta and metrial gland transcriptome were observed between control and FOXA2 cKO mice. The transcriptome of the placenta with a female fetus was considerably more altered than the placenta with a male fetus in FOXA2 cKO dams. These studies reveal previously unrecognized sexually dimorphic effects of FOXA2 and uterine glands on fetoplacental development with potential impacts on offspring health into adulthood.",FALSE,,

Quantification of raw counts per gene was done using cuffquant (cufflinks version 2.2.1) with parameters -b -u -M (masking for genes of type IG, TR, rRNA, tRNA, miRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, lincRNA and misc_RNA).
Raw counts were obtained by running cuffnorm on the cuffquant output.
Normalization and differential expression were done with DESeq2 version 1.6.3, for each tissue separately, while filtering out genes with a total of less than 2 counts in all samples, and using default parameters. The significance threshold was set to padj<0.1
Differential expression results were combined with gene details taken from BioMart (Ensembl, release 78).

Read counts per gene were also calculated using STAR (option - quantMode GeneCounts).
Differential expression analysis was performed in R 3.5.0 employing RUVSeq. Briefly, the Bioconductor package EDASeq (version 2.14.0) was used for initial data exploration and upper quartile normalization. In the next step unwanted sources of variation were estimated using the Bioconductor package RUVSeq (version 1.14.0). All samples for one experiment (embryo or CA) were normalized together. The parameter k was set to the minimum value that yielded good separation of sample groups in the PCA plot. Differential expression analysis was performed using the EdgeR package (version 3.22.2) including the RUV variables in the design as described. Genes with FDR<=0.05 were deemed significantly differentially expressed.

In this step, clean data (clean reads) were obtained by removing reads containing adapters, reads containing poly-N, and low-quality reads from the raw data. At the same time, Q20, Q30, and GC content in the clean data were calculated. All downstream analyses were based on clean data of high quality.
Read mapping to the reference genome: The reference genome and gene model annotation files were downloaded from the genome website( https://www.genome.gov/)
Quantification of gene expression level: featureCounts v1.5.0-p3 was used to count the read numbers mapped to each gene. Then, the FPKM of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to this gene.
Differential expression analysis: Prior to DEG analysis, for each sequenced library, the read counts were adjusted using the edgeR program package through one scaling normalized factor. Differential expression analysis of two conditions was performed using the edgeR R package (3.18.1). The P values were adjusted using the Benjamini & Hochberg method. A corrected P-value of 0.05 and absolute fold-change of 2 were set as the threshold for significant differential expression.
GO and KEGG enrichment analysis: For DEGs, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was implemented using the clusterProfiler R package, in which gene length bias was corrected. GO terms with corrected P values less than 0.05 were considered significantly enriched based on DEGs. The KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as the cell, the organism, and the ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-through put experimental technologies (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).

For each gestational time point, except for E5.5, the uterus wall surrounding the implantation sites was removed. Subsequently, the E6.5 and E7.5 embryos were dissected out of the decidua and digested using 1 mg/ml collagenase type I (Worthington Biochemical) containing 20% (v/v) FBS at 37°C for 5-10 min. The embryos at E8.5, E9.5 and E10.5 were removed and excluded from the study. Yolk sacs of the embryos at E8.5, E9.5 and E10.5, and the E10.5 placentas were washed in PBS and minced into small pieces of approximately 1-2 mm3 using scissors. The cells were then dissociated at 37°C for 20-30 min using 1 mg/ml collagenase type I (Worthington Biochemical) supplemented with 20% (v/v) FBS. The decidua of E5.5, E6.5, E7.5, E8.5 and E9.5 embryos were washed in PBS and minced into small pieces of approximately 1-2 mm3 using scissors. The tissues were then repeatedly digested using 0.5% (w/v) collagenase type I (Worthington Biochemical) dissolved in PBS with 5 mM glucose and 20 µl/ml deoxyribonuclease I (Promega) for 10 min and 0.25% trypsin (Gibco) for 5 min at 37°C on a rotator. Trypsin was deactivated using PBS containing 10% (v/v) FBS. The dissociated cells were filtered through a 40 µm cell strainer (Corning Falcon™, Cat# 352340) and centrifuged at 230 g for 5 min at 4°C. Subsequently, the dissociated cells were washed two times in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 2% (v/v) FBS.
To generate Gel Bead-InEMulsions (GEMs), 12,000 living cells, Chromium Single Cell 3’ GEM Kit v3 and Chromium Single Cell 3’ Gel Bead Kit v3 were used and loaded on a Chromium Single Cell Controller (10x Genomics). Recovered cDNA was used to construct library using the Single Cell 3’ Library kit (10x Genomics), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The libraries were subjected to Illumina HiSeq X Ten and Nova-seq 6000 sequencing system.; E6.5-E9.5 implantation sites of normal pregnant ICR mice and E8.5 and E9.5 implantation sites of DBA/2-mated CBA/J mice were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T.

BGI-Qingdao, Qingdao, China, performed sample library construction for scStereo-seq as described previously. 17 Cryosections of approximately 10 mm were cut and were attached to the scStereo-seq capture chip (1 cm x 1 cm), with spot size of 220 nm and center-to-center distance of 715 nm, and incubated at 37 _x0002_ C for 3 min. The tissue slides were ﬁxed and then stained a nucleic acid dye to assess the resolution of the data after sequencing. The tissue sections adjacent to the ones for scStereo-seq were used to examine the histology of the tissue structure through H&E stainings. The tissue sections attached to the chips were then permeabilized and the released RNA was then captured by the DNA nanoballs (DNB) on the chip. Then, the captured RNA was in situ reverse transcribed to generate cDNA. After tissue digestion and Exonuclease I treatment, the cDNA was ampliﬁed. For library construction, 20 mg of the cDNA was used for fragmentation and ampliﬁcation. Finally, the resulting PCR products were puriﬁed, and used for DNB generation. Then, the libraries were sequenced on a MGI DNBSEQ-Tx sequencer.

        For single-cell RNA seq, cellranger was used for the pre-processing and Seurat was used for the downstream analysis.
Assembly: mm10; Paired-end raw sequencing fastq reads were generated by MGI DNBSEQ-TX sequencer. Read 1 contained the CID (coordinate identity) and the MID (molecular identiﬁer, UMI), and Read 2 contained the cDNA sequence. By mapping the CID with the chip, the coordinates were obtained. After preprocessing, retained reads were aligned to the reference genome (mm10) by STAR and then the mapped reads were ﬁltered with MAPQ >=10 using handleBam. MID with the same CID and the same gene locus were collapsed. Finally, the gene expression matrix was generated using the exonic reads with CID information. The gene expression matrix was divided into X * X DNB (bin X), with X ∈ (10, 20, 50, 100), and the reads of the same gene were aggregated within each bin. In our data, DSCs have a large cell size and therefore we used bin 50, whereas the immune cells have a smaller cell size and we thus used bin 20. Then the data were transferred to Seurat for the downstream analyses. Initially, we employed the SCTransform function to normalize and scale the raw matrix of scStereo-seq data. Next, we performed unsupervised cell clustering on each slide data using the FindCluster function, with a resolution parameter of 0.3 (res = 0.3), similar to the scRNA-seq method. Finally, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimension reduction analysis was used to display the clustering results.

Transcripts were assembled and quantified using StringTie (v1.3.6) (Pertea et al., 2015, 2016), with reference file to guide assembly and the “reference transcripts only” option, and output count files for differential expression with DESeq2/edgeR/limma-voom. Differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2 (version 2.11.40.6+galaxy1) (Anders and Huber, 2010; Love, Huber and Anders, 2014).

We elucidated a distinct mechanism for X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in cynomolgus monkeys, a model for human development. The trophectoderm and cytotrophoblast acquire XCI around implantation through an active intermediate bearing repressive modifications and compacted structure, whereas the amnion, epiblast, and hypoblast maintain such an intermediate protractedly, attaining XCI by a week after implantation. Males achieve X chromosome up-regulation (XCU) progressively, whereas females show XCU coincidentally with XCI, both establishing the X:autosome dosage compensation by 1 week after implantation. Conversely, primordial germ cells undergo X chromosome reactivation by reversing the XCI pathway early during their development. Our findings establish a foundation for clarifying the dosage compensation mechanisms in primates, including humans.",.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,,

The colonies were fully dislodged from the substratum by gentle scraping and nuclei were isolated from the disassociated cells using the protocol provided by 10X genomics with minor modification. Briefly, 1 ml of chilled lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet™ P40 Substitute in Nuclease-Free Water) was added to each well through a wide-bore pipet tip. After gently pipetting several times, the suspension was kept on ice for 5 min to achieve maximum lysis of cells and then centrifuged (500x g; 5 min at 4°C). The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of nuclear wash and resuspension buffer (NWRB) (1X PBS with 1.0 % w/v bovine serum albumin) and 0.2U/μl RNase inhibitor (Roche, cat# 03335399001), cell debris was removed by filtration through a 40 µm Nylon cell strainer (Falcon), and recentrifuged as above. The supernatant solution was removed, and the final nuclear pellet suspended in 1ml of NWRB.

Briefly, nuclear suspension concentration and viability (unbroken cells) were measured with an Invitrogen Countess II automated cell counter. Nuclear suspension (1000 nuclei per microliter), reverse transcription master mix, and partitioning oil were loaded on a Chromium Next GEM G chip with a nuclear capture target of 5,000 nuclei per library. Post-Chromium controller GEMs were transferred to a PCR strip tube and reverse transcription performed on an Applied Biosystems Veriti thermal cycler at 53°C for 45 min. cDNA was amplified for 14 cycles and purified using Axygen AxyPrep MagPCR Clean-up beads. cDNA fragmentation, end-repair, A-tailing and ligation of sequencing adaptors was performed according to manufacturer specifications. The final library was quantified with the Qubit HS DNA kit and the fragment size was analyzed using an Agilent Fragment Analyzer system.
